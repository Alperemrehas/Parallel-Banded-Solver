##Parallel Banded Linear System Solver
#Overview
This project implements a Parallel Banded Linear System Solver using the Cyclic Reduction Algorithm (CRA), specifically the Cyclic Odd-Even Reduction (COER) method. The goal is to solve large-scale banded matrices efficiently using parallel computing while minimizing communication overhead between processors.
